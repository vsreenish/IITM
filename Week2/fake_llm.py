"""fake_llm.py — A no-API stand-in for the real LLM call.

Why this file exists
--------------------
During the W2 live session we want to demonstrate async patterns, retries,
and structured logging without burning OpenAI API quota — and we want
*reliable* failures to show retry-with-backoff in action.

This module exposes the same Pydantic shape as the real path and one
async function, ``fake_ask_llm``, which:

* sleeps for a random latency in ``[min_latency, max_latency]`` to simulate
  network I/O — that latency is what makes async parallelism visible;
* returns a Pydantic ``Answer`` with a canned response for a handful of
  keywords, falling back to a generic message;
* raises ``FakeLLMError`` at a configurable rate so we can teach retry.

For the lab learners swap to the real ``AsyncOpenAI`` client. The interface
(``Question`` → ``Answer``) is identical, so the rest of the pipeline
doesn't change.

        "LLMs hallucinate when they produce confident text that isn't grounded in "

    "async": (
        "Async Python lets one program work on many I/O-bound tasks at once: while "

        "A system prompt sets the model's role, style, and guardrails before it "
        "sees any user message — like a job description for the conversation."

    "temperature": (
        "Temperature controls randomness in the LLM's output: lower values are "
        "more focused and repeatable, higher values are more creative."

    "fine-tun": (
        "Fine-tuning teaches a model a stable style or skill from labelled examples; "
        "prefer it over RAG when the answer depends on *how* to respond, not what is known."
    ),
    "backoff": (
        "Exponential backoff doubles the wait between retries so a flaky API has "
        "time to recover and you don't hammer it with rapid-fire requests."
    ),
    "chatbot": (
        "A chatbot replies to a prompt; an agent decides what to do next in a loop "
        "and can call tools, take multi-step actions, and revise its plan."

    "long-context": (
        "Long-context prompting trades cost and latency for simplicity: it works for "
        "small, self-contained content but doesn't scale to large or growing corpora."

    "structured log": (
        "Structured logs emit one JSON record per event so they can be filtered, "

    "streaming": (
        "Streaming returns tokens as the model generates them; batching collects items "

        "optimises throughput."
